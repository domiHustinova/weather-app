# Weather App

Initially, I created this app with a vanilla JavaScript for the Czechitas JavaScript course. HTML, CSS, images, and some helper functions were provided by the course mentor. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/domihustinova/javascript2-ukol07-pocasi).

I've decided to recreate this app using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/). The Weather App is not finished, the following functionalities are on my to-do list:

- fix forecast functionality
- add the dark theme
- ~~add the language selector~~ âœ…
- add the unit selector
- add the geolocation using [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)
- change colors according to the current temperature
- add an input field for the city search
- migrate the app to TypeScript
