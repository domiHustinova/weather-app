# Weather App

Initially, I created this Weather App in JavaScript as a homework for Czechitas JavaScript course. HTML, CSS, images and some helper functions were provided by the course mentor. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/domihustinova/javascript2-ukol07-pocasi).

I've decided to recreate this app using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/). The Weather App is not finished, following functionalities are on my to-do list:

- fix forecast functionality
- add dark theme
- add language selector
- add unit selector
- add geolocation using [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)
- add color change based on the current temperature
- add input field to select own city
